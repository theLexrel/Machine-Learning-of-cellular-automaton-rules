# Machine-Learning-of-cellular-automaton-rules
Code written for the master thesis 'Machine Learning of cellular automaton rules' by Max MÃ¼ller at TU Dresden, 2022/23

## Use of the code in the master thesis
The files were used for the following purpose in the master thesis:
- CA_1D.py
  - Thesis_visuals(): The examples of the CA time series in section 2.2, Cellular Automaton - CA in 1D
  - Thesis_proveOfConcept(): The figures, extracted transition probabilities and calculated error measures in section 5.2.1, Rule extraction from a CA time series - Proof of concept for CA in 1D 
  - Thesis_realData(): The figures, extracted transition probabilities and calculated error measures in section 5.3.1, Rule extraction from a CA time series - Simulation of 'real' data in 1D 
- CA_2D.py 
  - Thesis_visuals(): The examples of the CA time series in section 2.3, Cellular Automaton - CA in 2D
  - Thesis_proveOfConcept(): The figures, extracted transition probabilities and calculated error measures in section 5.2.2, Rule extraction from a CA time series - Proof of concept for CA in 2D 
  - Thesis_Thesis_real_correctNeighborhood(): The figures, extracted transition probabilities and calculated error measures for a correct match between hypothesis implementation and neighborhood used by the update rule in section 5.3.2, Rule extraction from a CA time series - Simulation of 'real' data in 2D
  - Thesis_Thesis_real_wrongNeighborhood(): The figures, extracted transition probabilities and calculated error measures for a correct mismatch between hypothesis implementation and neighborhood used by the update rule in section 5.3.2, Rule extraction from a CA time series - Simulation of 'real' data in 2D  - LGCA_1D.py
  - Thesis_ExtractionInteractionStrenght(): The figures and extracted coefficients for the LGCA with a 1D lattice in section 6.2.1, Rule extraction from LGCA time series - LGCA time series generated by update rule with known functional form --  Testing the ML algorithm in 1D 
  - Thesis_GeneralApproach(): The figures for the LGCA with a 1D lattice in section 6.3.2, Rule extraction from LGCA time series - LGCA time series generated by update rule with unknown functional form -- Testing the ML algorithm in 1D 
- LGCA_2D.py:
  - main(): builds figures used in section 6.2.3 and 6.3.3 for the LGCA with a 2D lattice and gives out the corresponding coefficients 
  
## Required packages
The python code will only run with the packages *matpltlib*, *numy* and *sklearn* with CA_2D.py additionally requiring *numba* and LGCA_1D.py & LGCA_2D.py needing the external software package *BIO-LGCA*. The last one was introduced in the paper *'BIO-LGCA: A cellular automaton modelling class for analysing collective cell migration'* by Deutsch et al, published in PLOS Computational Biology in June 2021 (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009066> link </a>), which is accessible on <a href=https://github.com/sisyga/BIO-LGCA>github</a>.

## General comments on the code
As its code was mainly written to solve the given task or the plot figures for the thesis, the focus wasn't on writting the best possible version but on writting a functional one. Especially for the CA python files, the code presented here is built from components of (many) previous versions. Hence, it inherited some aspects of them which aren't necessarily the best choice for the present code. Due to time limitations, the code doesn't have a lot of comments.
